# HDDT

## Hellinger distance decision tree

### This is largely UNTESTED so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

HDDT have been proposed to work well with imbalanced data [1].

The R file contains functions to create Hellinger distance decision tree (HDDT) given training data.
It also provides a function to use a learned decision tree to predict new data. 

I am currently using simple lists to store the tree. There are currently no functions to visualize the tree.

I will be happy to get feedback and make improvements, or even better if you have implemented improvements :)
